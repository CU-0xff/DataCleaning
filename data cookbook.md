#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Work

##Pre-requisites

Set the current working directory so it contains `getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip` downloaded from `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip`

##Function `read_in_data()`

The function (1) reads in parts of the above described file (test and train data, labels), (2) combines test and train data, (3) extracts only means and standard deviations, (4) properly apply column names, and (4) calculates averages. It results in two data.frames called `data_set` and `average_set`. `data_set` contains the combined data of means and standard deviations with proper column names. `averages_set` contains the averages over the activities.
The variable `time_stamp` is set to the time when the function is called to record the time stamp of the data.

##Resulting Data

The column names follow the original naming convention as quoted here:

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

##Data Frames

###averages_set
Contains six rows named

LAYING

SITTING

STANDING

WALKING

WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

WALKING_UPSTAIRS

Each row contains 66 columns with the averages of means and standard deviations. The column names start with avg_ to reflect this. Otherwise the names follow the same scheme as described in data_set.
